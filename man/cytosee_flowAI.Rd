\arguments{
\item{fcsfiles}{It can be a character vector with the filenames of the FCS files,
a flowSet or a flowFrame.}

\item{remove_from}{Select from which of the three steps the anomalies have to be
excluded in the high quality FCS file. The default option \code{"all"} removes the
anomalies from all the three steps. Alternatively, you can use:
\code{"FR_FS", "FR_FM", "FS_FM", "FR", "FS", "FM"}, to remove the anomalies only
on a subset of the steps where \emph{FR} stands for the flow rate, \emph{FS} stands
for signal acquisition and \emph{FM} stands for dynamic range.}

\item{output}{Set it to 1 to return a flowFrame or a flowSet with high quality events only.
Set it to 2 to return a flowFrame or a flowSet with an additional
parameter where the low quality events have a value higher than 10,000.
Set it to 3 to return  a list with the IDs of low quality cells. Set it to any other
value if no R object has to be returned. Default is \code{1}.}

\item{timeCh}{Character string corresponding to the name of the Time Channel
in the set of FCS files. By default is \code{NULL} and the name is retrieved
automatically.}

\item{second_fractionFR}{The fraction of a second that is used to split
the time channel in order to recreate the flow rate. Set it to
\code{"timestep"} if you wish to recreate the flow rate at the maximum
resolution allowed by the flow cytometry instrument. Usually, the timestep
corresponds to 0.01, however, to shorten the running time of the analysis the
fraction used by default is 0.1, corresponding to 1/10 of a second.}

\item{alphaFR}{The level of statistical significance used to
accept anomalies detected by the ESD method. The default value is \code{0.01}.}

\item{decompFR}{Logical indicating whether the flow rate should be decomposed
in the trend and cyclical components. Default is \code{TRUE} and the ESD
outlier detection will be executed on the trend component penalized by the
magnitude of the cyclical component. If it is \code{FALSE} the ESD outlier
detection will be executed on the original flow rate.}

\item{ChRemoveFS}{Add a character vector with the names or name portions
of the channels that you want to exclude from the signal acquisition check.
The default option, \code{c("FSC", "SSC")}, excludes the scatter parameters.
If you want to include all the parameters in the analysis use \code{NULL}.}

\item{outlierFS}{logical indicating whether outliers have to be removed
before the changepoint detection of the signal acquisition check.
The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{pen_valueFS}{The value of the penalty for the changepoint detection
algorithm. This can be a numeric value or text giving the formula to use;
for instance, you can use the character string \code{"1.5*log(n)"},
where n indicates the number of cells in the FCS file. The higher the
penalty value the less strict is the detection of the anomalies.
The default is \code{200}.}

\item{max_cptFS}{The maximum number of changepoints that can be detected
for each channel. The default is \code{3}.}

\item{ChFM}{A character vector that indicates which channels need to include
for the dynamic range check. The default option is \code{NULL} and
with it all the channels are selected for the analysis.}

\item{sideFM}{Select whether the dynamic range check has to be executed on
both limits, the upper limit or the lower limit. Use one of the options:
\code{"both", "upper", "lower"}. The default is \code{"both"}.}

\item{neg_valuesFM}{Scalar indicating the method to use for the removal of the
anomalies from the lower limit of the dynamic range. Use \code{1} to remove
negative outliers or use \code{2} to truncate the negative values to the cut-off
indicated in the FCS file.}

\item{html_report}{Suffix to be added to the FCS filename to name the HTML
report of the quality control. The default is \code{"_QC"}. If you do not
want to generate a report use \code{FALSE}.}

\item{mini_report}{Name for the TXT file containing the percentage of
anomalies detected in the set of FCS files
analyzed. The default is \code{"_QCmini"}. If you do not want to generate
the mini report use \code{FALSE}.}

\item{fcs_QC}{Suffix to be added for the filename of the new FCS
containing a new parameter where the low quality events only have a value
higher than 10,000. The default is \code{"_QC"}.
If you do not want to generate the high quality FCS file use \code{FALSE}.}

\item{fcs_highQ}{Suffix to be added for the filename of the new FCS
containing only the events that passed the quality control. The default
is \code{FALSE} and hence the high quality FCS file is not generated.}

\item{fcs_lowQ}{Suffix to be added for the filename of the new FCS
containing only the events that did not pass the quality control. The default
is \code{FALSE} and hence the low quality FCS file is not generated.}

\item{folder_results}{Character string used to name the directory that
contains the results. The default is \code{"resultsQC"}. If you intend
to return the results in the working directory use \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A complete quality control is performed on flow cytometry data in FCS
format. By default the analysis returns:

1. a flowFrame or flowSet object containing new FCS files with only high quality events

and a directory named \var{resultsQC} containing:

1. a set of new FCS files with a new parameter to gate out the low quality events a value larger than 10,000 is assigned to them only,

2. a set of HTML reports, one for each FCS file, that include graphs and table indicating where the anomalies were detected,

3. a single TXT file reporting the percentage of events removed in each FCS file.
}
\description{
For a set of FCS files, \emph{flow_auto_qc} performs a complete and automatic
quality control. It consists in the detection and removal of
anomalies by checking three properties of flow cytometry: 1) flow rate,
2) signal acquisition, 3) dynamic range.
